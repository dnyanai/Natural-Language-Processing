## üîë Key Problem Solved

**Challenge**: Information overload during COVID-19 pandemic - scattered non-medical information across 200K+ articles with no way to discover relationships, connect concepts, or perform semantic queries.

**The Gap or improvement opportunity**:
Traditional keyword search and document retrieval methods fall short because they:
- Cannot capture semantic relationships between entities
- Fail to connect information across multiple documents
- Don't reveal hidden patterns and connections
- Provide no mechanism for relationship-based querying

**Solution**: Automated NLP pipeline that extracts entities and relationships from articles, constructs a knowledge graph in Neo4j, and enables visual exploration and semantic querying.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Pipeline (5 Stages)

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Filter articles by domain (Tech, Automotive)
   - Clean text (remove URLs, hashtags, special chars)
   - Summarize articles to preserve key content

2. **Triple Extraction** (Dual Approach)
   - **Path I**: Noun-Verb-Noun pattern matching
   - **Path II**: Noun chunk dependency parsing
   - Extract (Subject, Predicate, Object) triples

3. **Validation & Export**
   - Manual quality verification
   - Remove redundancies
   - Generate CSV files (Nodes, Links, Triples)

4. **Graph Database**
   - Import to Neo4j using Cypher
   - Create dynamic relationships with APOC plugin
   - Build queryable knowledge graph

5. **Visualization**
   - NetworkD3 interactive visualizations
   - Neo4j Browser native rendering
   - Force-directed graph layouts
