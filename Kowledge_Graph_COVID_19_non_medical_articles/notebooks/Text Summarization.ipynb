       "'A case of the new virus spreading rapidly in China has been reported in a patient in Seattle, Washington, Reuters reports. The patient had recently returned from China, and is clinically healthy but still being monitored. This is the first US case of the virus, which was first detected in Wuhan, a city in central China in late December 2019. It has already sickened around 300 people and killed six. Despite the case report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said during a press briefing that they believe the threat to the US remains low. The virus is currently known as 2019-nCoV. The designation indicates that it is a coronavirus, the family of viruses that also caused the SARS outbreak in 2003. That outbreak killed nearly 800 people. “It’s bringing back SARS flashbacks for me,” says Timothy Sheahan, a coronavirus expert and assistant professor at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health. The US patient flew into Seattle-Tacoma Internati'"

       "'A case of the new virus spreading rapidly in China has been reported in a patient in Seattle  Washington  Reuters reports. The patient had recently returned from China  and is clinically healthy but still being monitored. This is the first US case of the virus  which was first detected in Wuhan  a city in central China in late December 2019. It has already sickened around 300 people and killed six. Despite the case report  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  said during a press briefing that they believe the threat to the US remains low. The virus is currently known as 2019 nCoV. The designation indicates that it is a coronavirus  the family of viruses that also caused the SARS outbreak in 2003. That outbreak killed nearly 800 people. “It’s bringing back SARS flashbacks for me ” says Timothy Sheahan  a coronavirus expert and assistant professor at the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public Health. The US patient flew into Seattle Tacoma International Airport on January 15th and reported symptoms to his medical provider on Sunday  January 19th. The patient was familiar with the reports of the Wuhan virus and shared them with his provider  and the positive test for the coronavirus came back yesterday. He poses little risk to hospital staff or to the general public and is cooperating fully  the CDC said in its briefing. On January 17th  the CDC started enhanced health screenings at San Francisco International Airport  John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York  and Los Angeles International Airport for passengers who flew from or connected through Wuhan. The agency will begin screening at Chicago O’Hare International Airport and Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport this week. Any flights from or connecting through Wuhan will also begin to be funneled to those airports. Health officials’ experience with SARS makes them more prepared to respond to threats from coronaviruses  Sheahan says. “People are aware. Before SARS  people had no idea this could happen. I think everyone is much more prepared now in 2020 than we were in 2002.” Coronaviruses are common in animals  and can evolve into forms that can be passed to and infect humans. The virus that caused SARS  for example  originated in bats. The World Health Organization has identified a wholesale seafood market in Wuhan as a possible source of the virus  but it also noted that “some laboratory confirmed patients did not report visiting this market.” One of the most pressing questions about the new virus is how easily it spreads. Chinese health authorities said this week that there has been at least one confirmed case where the virus passed directly from one person to another without passing through an animal reservoir. “The key issue we need to understand is how easily or sustainably the virus is spread from human to human ” says Nancy Messonnier  director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the CDC. An expert panel at the World Health Organization is meeting on Wednesday  January 22nd to determine if it should declare a global public health emergency. Update January 21st  3 08PM ET  This report was updated to include new information from the CDC. '"

demand.', '“What we know about this virus is there is no immunity in the population — meaning that this will continue to spread ” he said.', '“We are lucky to be well funded and have raised a lot of capital ” said Shaam.', 'All of the European countries seem to be in lockdown.', '“We thought that the government — especially in Spain where most of our team is — is not reacting fast enough and aggressively enough  to Covid 19 .', '“China is actually starting to open up a little bit but at the peak we looked at 100  — nothing was being booked in terms of destination.', 'You still will have a tonne of business travel when we come back out of it.” “If we zoom out a bit from this situation — there is a trend for more sustainable approach to travel ” Meir added.', '“Although it’s going to increase dramatically our costs in customer care it’s the right thing to do for our customers ” he said of that particular coronavirus triggered business adjustment.', '“It’s the best company in the world for duty of care ” said Meir.', '“The focus right now as an organization is really on the day by day — we need to make sure we keep providing the service ” he said.', 'So we are doing quite a bit in order to make sure that they survive and that they get the revenue through our platform that they deserve.” Zooming out  Reck told us he’s taking “a really long term view” on travel.', '“We actually are switching some of our sales team to customer support in the coming weeks just to support the volume of tickets ” he noted.', '“The good news is that as we come from a position of strength and we will survive and prevail for sure.', '“Again  there’s a lot of uncertainty but I feel that the best thing I can do is bring stability  bring confidence into the organization.” TravelPerk’s Meir said the business is also most focused on responding to immediate challenges and needs — including keeping up with the demand it’s seeing.', 'If we have a request for a feature like ‘duty of care’ — which makes tonnes of sense right now — we’re going to shift the roadmap and do more of these kind of things.” “This is a moment to be decisive and adaptable but also courageous and to invest in what makes TravelPerk stronger this year  next year and ten years ” he added.', 'We just think our culture is much stronger when people are physically in the same space and we switched from nobody does remote work to 100  remote ” he told us.', 'So we should keep hiring  we should keep investing in the product  we should keep investing in our service — so my biggest worry is that we  don’t  act out of panic or out of confusion — and that’s something we should be aware of and not do.', 'This is a thing that we’re going to do more and more as this situation evolves.', '“We are in an incredible position because we’ve raised this massive round last year and we haven’t spent a lot of it ” said GetYourGuide’s Reck.', 'Before this crisis predicted growth of 6 or 7  in 2020 — which is huge compared to the size of the market.', '“We had two weeks to prepare which I guess put us ahead of the curve for most other US and European companies ” said Reck.', 'And we as a travel company will adapt like we always have ” he added.', '“Most of the trips we see right now is somebody booking for tomorrow or for two days from now because they for know they can travel or have certainty they can travel ” said Meir.', '“We’re already ahead of the curve in product but this is a really good opportunity to keep pushing on our strengths and another one we’re doing is adjusting the business and the business model as well.” Meir gave the example of a premium concierge service which it’s just decided to provide for free for all its users for the next three months.', 'FlexiPerk has been really  really on fire over the past few weeks — both in terms of users  those who are already on FlexiPerk and also new sign ups which is actually driving a lot of our growth in terms of signs ups.', 'At this point in time we believe there’s incredible opportunity to make a real different for our customers  our suppliers and our ecosystem broadly ” Reck added.', '“One of the projects that we chose is efficient cooking stoves in Rwanda.” GreenPerk uses an algorithm to calculate the carbon footprint of a given trip and then applies a per booking fee proportional to the pollution created — with the fee going to fund the carbon offset project.', '“There’s a lot of practical questions that come up — like the design team need to take their chunky monitors home so they can actually design.', 'This is really unfair for the elderly and those who have previous health conditions…So we decided to take action… And I was just amazed how fast we transitioned from a company that doesn’t do remote to full on remote.” GetYourGuide has also gone fully remote.', 'We’re doing it for the US because of the travel ban now.', 'And we want to be ready for that.', '“It’s one of those topics that in normal times people don’t really like to think about it — but this is probably the highest request we were getting in the past 2 3 weeks from customers.”  “We went from idea to releasing it in less than 5 days of work ” he added.', 'If you’d ask me we might see some reopening of the travel landscape in summer but I think that will be far diminished from a typical season.', '“But we see a spike in short term last minute trips when people feel comfortable on the region — so that’s gone up a lot.” TravelPerk  told us it’s currently dealing with a drop in business globally of around 50 .', 'So I think the answer to that largely depends on how co ordinated and how quickly we can contain.', 'So you have a huge decrease in the booking window.” While of its flagship products is actually seeing high demand in the current crisis situation  per Meir — given it’s designed to offer resilience against unforeseen changes to plans.', 'There’s huge psychological pressure — the travel market’s going down  the stock market’s going down — so for me by biggest role is to keep that strong engagement and morale and that people don’t feel threatened by the situation around them.” As it happens  Reck is a biochemist by education — so likely one of relatively few founders in the travel space with hands on lab experience of viruses.', 'So this will be a year of extreme turbulence of the travel market.” For Omio  it’s a similar story — with bookings over the last two weeks down between 30 40  overall across all markets  according to founder and CEO Naren Shaam  and a big spike in demand for customer service as worried customers look to cancel trips.', '“Customers can now cancel all of the experiences 24 hours in advance  no questions asked  for a refund.', '“The whole company is actually stepping in to help customer service because we’ve seen a spike in cancellations ” he said.', 'We wanted actually to make a difference ” said Meir.', 'So we can really double down on significantly improving the product for our customer and that means giving a better search and discovery experience  more personalized  curating more GetYourGuide Originals with our suppliers… So that when we come out of this crisis we come out with a better technology product and a much better supply base.” “I think  as I said  just surviving will be a competitive advantage.', 'He’s also braced for the longest ‘nuclear winter’ of business disruption of the three startups we spoke to.', 'And FlexiPerk really plugs this gap because it allows you to book now for September knowing that if you have to change your plans you can do so without losing the money.” “Right now most of the airlines have changed their cancelation policies so we are able to get full refunds in many cases ” he added.', '“We keep actually selling and a lot of companies are signing up.', 'So we’re rather taking the opportunity now to really focus on product and engineering — and that’s something really liberating to me.', 'Right now what we’re doing is bottling that in for 3 4 months but you’ve got to open the lid at some point — I hope — and when that comes out the demand will grow even faster.', '“This is expected to

you’re handling the covered entity’s data and have the same restrictions apply to you.', 'And depending on what type of support it’s providing for covered entities it may be in limited circumstances could be considered a business associate that could be subject to HIPAA but in the context of just collecting data on consumers it wouldn’t be governed by that.', 'It doesn’t need to be specific to the type of search that you’re running.', 'So it’s tightened for California residents but for the rest of the US you just have to be consistent with your privacy policy and you aren’t required to have the same level of disclosures.', 'That’s not to say in the future we might see a tightening of restrictions on that but individuals are freely giving that information — and in theory should read the privacy policy that’s provided when you log into the app.', 'Another important topic in that field is the use of telecommunications data — in particular mobile phone data.', 'So the fact that it’s looking up how to get COVID testing or treatment or what are the symptoms for COVID  things like that  that can all be tied to the data  it holds on users  and enriched.', 'And what they basically said was it always needs to be figured out on a case by case basis whether the data is really required in the specific case.', 'If Internet companies such as Google were to be asked by European governments to pass data on users for a coronavirus tracking purpose  it has to be taken into consideration that they have not included this in their records of processing activities — in their data protection notifications and information.', 'This is the baseline on which we need to work and for which we need to start.', 'The interesting thing to me is maybe the approach that Asia has taken — where they have a lot more influence over the commercial sector and data tracking–  and so you actually have the regulator stepping in and doing more tracking  not just private companies.', 'And that’s a bit narrower than the definition of personal data that you’d have under GDPR.', 'So they’re giving a waiver or just softening some of the restrictions related to transferring health data electronically.', 'When they would like to make use of mobile phone data this is the ePrivacy directive.', 'So there’s a lot of different puzzle pieces that fit together since we have a patchwork quilt of data protection — depending on the different state and federal laws.', 'You really need to look at the specific case and see how to get the data you need.', 'This is not as transparent as the GDPR is and they did not succeed in replacing that piece of legislation by new regulation.', 'So there is a focus on privacy even though we don’t have a national privacy law  equivalent in scope to the EU’s GDPR  but it’s coming from a consumer protection point of view.', 'In that context they would be governed by some of the same privacy and security regulations under HIPAA.', 'And in them having to be transparent and act within that privacy policy.', 'And the fact that we have a state of emergency doesn’t change that emphasis on consumer protection.', 'They could share it with a regulator  they could sell it to other third parties so long as they have the proper disclosure that they may sell your personal information or share it with third parties.', 'So you can see it’s an evolving situation but they’ve still taken a very reserved and kind of conservative approach — really emphasizing that you do need to comply with your obligation to protect health data.', 'And so while you may not need full consent in the US you would still need to have notice and transparency about the policies.', 'So they listed a couple of different exceptions how you can share that information but really stressing the minimum necessary.', 'And that can also be shared and sold to third parties — unless you’re a California resident.', 'Tracking people  tracking and monitoring what they are doing this is almost last resort — so I wouldn’t expect that in the next couple of weeks.', 'I would envisage more of a call to arms requesting support and assistance from the private sector.', 'Then it would be slightly different if you’re a California resident — the degree that you need under the new California law  CCPA  to provide disclosures and give individuals the opportunity to opt out if you were to share their information.', 'But they’re kind of operating on a global platform and trying to have a global privacy policy.']\n",

battery to make space for the larger camera module  which means its run times are likely to be a little lower.', 'The occlusion is unrealistically blurry at this point  but with the prior generation iPad Pro  the digital model appears to be overlapping everything rather than blending in at all.', 'However  the case provides full iPad protection  and the backlit keyboard includes a row of function keys  unlike Apple’s.', 'But unlike 3D Touch  which was merely one of multiple new “major” iPhone features in its day  the lidar sensor is the signature differentiator between this iPad and its predecessor.', 'Consequently  this isn’t a model I’d recommend to most purchasers of the 2018 iPad Pro  and I’m hesitant to suggest that anyone else buy into it — absent a very concrete need for either 2018 caliber flagship tablet performance or AR specific features.', 'All of this is to say that both new models deliver superior value for the dollar  compared with their predecessors  though the differences aren’t night and day.', 'The 2020 iPad Pro is a slightly better piece of hardware  but its improvements won’t matter to most users  and at Apple’s flagship prices you should expect more than just small year over year gains.', 'So if you’re considering the purchase of a 2020 iPad Pro  here’s my advice  Unless you expect to aggressively use the improved camera system  look for a discontinued 2018 model instead.', 'As of today  users can use Bluetooth 5.0 or a USB C cable to connect the new iPad Pros  and many past iPads  to trackpads and mice  as well as future combined keyboard trackpad solutions.', 'A comprehensive system wide benchmark  Antutu  pegs the new iPad Pro at 742712 versus 2018’s 716358  a performance boost of only 3.7  between the A12X and A12Z.', 'Given some of these milestones  it’s easy to forget that Apple follows a tick tock pattern with iPad Pro releases  alternating between big updates and minor refreshes.', 'Like Microsoft’s Surface keyboards  this design uses a fabric and plastic housing and relies on a kickstand to prop the iPad up  which may be less than ideal for use on a lap.', 'As disclosed by spec sheets  the new iPad has an A12Z series chip  the first time Apple has used a “Z” as a suffix for one of its custom A series processors.', 'Made from space gray machined aluminum  it has a full plastic backlit keyboard and multi touch trackpad  its own battery  with three month longevity   a metal hinge  and a protective frame to hold the iPad Pro.', 'Despite the hardware’s potential  it’s hard to call it a giant leap forward for AR without great software  and Apple largely dropped the ball on delivering anything compelling for the new iPad Pro’s launch.', 'Apple’s Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro evolves its vinyl and microfiber Smart Folio with a combined keyboard and trackpad that look like smaller versions of those parts on a MacBook laptop.', 'It’s fair to say that most major iPad apps have proper support for both the 11 inch and 12.9 inch displays  with the vast majority also supporting multiple split screen multitasking features.', 'For reasons that aren’t yet entirely clear  Apple is focusing a lot of attention on the 2020 iPad Pro’s potential as an augmented reality display device.', 'One might assume this means that the iPad Pro’s ultrawide pictures are a little wider than the iPhone 11’s  with a slightly greater ability to “see” the totality of a room or other space with the 0.5X lens  a feature that matters for augmented reality.', 'As I said during my otherwise positive review of the last iPad Pro  Apple’s hardware was legitimately awesome by late 2018 hardware standards but crippled by its inability to serve as a convertible replacement for a laptop — something Microsoft has unquestionably done better with its Surface tablets.', 'The iPhone 11’s ultrawide camera takes noticeably wider and sharper photos than the new iPad Pro’s.']\n",

and transmit them to each other.', 'If any of the numbers match  the app alerts the user that they made contact with an infected person  and displays instructions or a video about getting tested or self quarantining.', 'The second problem is that when these Bluetooth chips do pass in the night  you should expect a large number of false positives.', 'Those same tactics — public health investigators making phone calls and working out in the community — seem to be the most effective tool we have for contact tracing.', 'Derek Thompson has a good piece on contact tracing in the

people confidence to return to work  they need to be paired with COVID 19 testing.', 'The app exchanges anonymous identifier codes like other Bluetooth apps do and is based on the idea that the current health care crisis shouldn’t lead to a backslide in privacy rights.', 'Perhaps the furthest along of all Bluetooth tracing apps for COVID 19 is Private Kit  Safe Paths  which is designed to eliminate the risk of government surveillance.', 'The cooperation of public health officials is essential for a number of reasons  not least of which is the need to assure notifications sent to users are credible and trustworthy.', 'That spirit is reflected in the group’s willingness to collaborate with other contact tracing apps on the TCN protocol.', 'COVID Watch  TraceTogether  a tracking app launched in Singapore   and other apps have the same problem.', 'Bluetooth contact tracing may provide the necessary tracking with a lower risk of violating civil liberties or handing sensitive data to governments.', 'The makers of COVID Watch said public health official cooperation is important because people need to trust that the notifications they get from the app are based on credible exposure.', 'White told VentureBeat that collaborators started work on the privacy conscious location tracking app in February after it emerged that China and South Korea were using location tracking apps to slow the spread of COVID 19.', 'Like the makers of Private Kit  Safe Paths  the COVID Watch team planned to create a heat map using epidemiological models  but they found that GPS anonymization is more challenging than Bluetooth anonymization and comes with increased privacy risks.', 'The way things work now  a person with an iPhone would have to walk around with their phone on all the time for a contact tracing app to work.', 'In what may be the biggest endorsement yet for the Bluetooth contact tracing method  Apple and Google recently announced that they’re partnering on a solution that combines Bluetooth  cryptology  and location tracking.', 'Creators of the app hail from MIT  Harvard University  and other East Coast institutions  they say they’re in talks with the WHO and over 30 countries around the world to work with Private Kit and make their own contact tracing apps.', 'We will remain vigilant moving forward to make sure any contract tracing app remains voluntary and decentralized and used only for public health purposes and only for the duration of this pandemic ” Granick said in a statement provided to VentureBeat.', 'But in contrast to DP3T  it offers a mix of centralized and decentralized approaches.', 'Because your phone’s contact tracing app needs to have Bluetooth always on for the app to work as designed  that could create problems.', 'Both apps are open source and are being made in the U.S. by a mix of cryptographers  privacy advocates  public health experts  and engineers.', 'You can’t do that with apps on 169 different types of phone and with peer to peer communications.” Anderson has a number of reservations about contact tracing apps  including the National Health Service’s  NHS  poor record with data protection.', 'The news promises the potential proliferation of Bluetooth contact tracing apps.', '“With the current protocol … the app would have to be put on in the foreground on their phone while they go around  which is annoying  and we’re trying to get around that.', 'VentureBeat spoke with the creators of COVID Watch and PrivateKit  Safe Paths in order to understand the difference between top offerings — and what needs to change.', '“So the healthy people never have to share their data  but for infected people  they can release that data in an anonymized  aggregated  and redacted fashion.', 'The COVID Watch group  which comprises around 200 Bluetooth experts  developers  privacy advocates  public health officials  and academic researchers  is working to discover the least privacy invasive way to track people during a pandemic.', 'Trials are also underway in multiple parts of the U.S.  from Alaska to Los Angeles and the Boston area.', 'Apple and Google will release an API in May  followed by a platform for building Bluetooth tracing into software in the months ahead.', 'With some of the biggest names in AI and security attached to it  Private Kit  Safe Paths attracted a fair amount of media attention when it launched last month.', 'Lending further credibility to this approach  Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden shared in a New York Times op ed on Sunday that privacy conscious contact tracing and abundant testing capabilities are essential aspects of his plan for restarting the economy.', 'Both Private Kit  Safe Paths and COVID Watch offer anonymized Bluetooth contact numbers  use the TCN protocol  and offer cryptographically secure contact tracing  but COVID Watch considers GPS tracking like the kind Private Kit  Safe Paths does to have significant potential privacy implications.', '“We strongly urge governments  health authorities  and researchers that any deployment of proximity tracing follows a decentralized design similar to our system to avoid the creation of centralized systems that have the potential to become surveillance infrastructures ” the DP3T group said in the paper.', 'Despite a willingness to partner with others  COVID Watch draws a sharp contrast between its approach and that of other proximity app makers.', 'White says they’ve found it  in the form of decentralized Bluetooth tracing.', '“To their credit  Apple and Google have announced an approach that appears to mitigate the worst privacy and centralization risks  but there is still room for improvement.', 'But decentralization advocates DP3T and COVID Watch believe strong personal privacy protection and high user trust can lead to higher rates of adoption for Bluetooth proximity tracing apps.']\n",

acceleration and deceleration  and we want to receive that information into simulation to predict what we think a rider or driver reaction would have been in the real world.', '“If you just focus on synthetic miles and don’t start bringing in some of the realism that you have from driving in the real world  it actually becomes very difficult to know where you are on that curve of realism ” said Karmel.', 'Ahead of testing in a new location  companies like Waymo and Cruise deploy sensor equipped  manually driven cars to map the routes driverless vehicles could possibly take.', 'Fortuitously  many of these companies have invested in simulation to scale testing beyond what’s possible in the real world.', 'The majority of learning and development is done in simulation  according to Karmel — well before updated versions of Waymo Driver hit real world roads.', 'ATG engineers use tools like DataViz  a web based interface that ATG developed in collaboration with Uber’s Data Visualization Team  to see how cars in simulation interpret and perceive the virtual world.', 'Waymo says it drives 20 million miles a day in its Carcraft simulation platform — the equivalent of over 100 years of real world driving on public roads.', 'Thompson says that Uber’s decision to ramp up development of its modeling and simulation tools over the past two years is paying dividends.', 'In lieu of all this  autonomous vehicle companies must rely on the data they’ve collected to date — and perturbations or modifications of that data — for system development and evaluation.', '“We have the capabilities to incrementally understand the real world as things change  and as we continue to make changes to improve the state of  our systems’  performance  we continue to  create  new challenges in simulation.” Above  Real world Waymo car data used in simulation.', 'The company says that in the months since Aurora halted all real world testing  its vehicle operators have joined forces with its triage and labeling teams to mine manual and autonomous driving data for on road events that can be turned into simulated virtual tests.', '“We will continue this rapid expansion of our simulation capability for the foreseeable future  and have no plans to reduce simulated miles driven even after the pandemic is behind us.” Lyft was in the midst of developing a new vehicle platform when it was forced to halt all real world testing.', 'This data is used to train the family of machine learning models that underpin driverless vehicles’ perception  prediction  and motion planning capabilities.', 'Aurora also says it’s building new tools  such as a web app designed to make crafting simulations even easier for engineers  and that it’s enhancing existing pipelines that will support the creation of new testing scenarios.', 'It’s the question of not just simulating a large number of miles  but simulating the right miles.” Lyft also reworked its validation strategy to weigh more heavily on things like structural and dynamic simulation in light of the pandemic  according to Dyer.', 'In something of a case in point  the company is now using over 2 million miles of sensor logs augmented with simulations to accomplish the “vast majority” of its AI training and validation  he said.', 'Together  they enable employees to inspect and debug information collected from offline and online testing  as well as to explore information in the process of creating new scenarios.', 'It’s also building out tools like a benchmarking framework that enables engineers to compare and improve the performance of behavior detectors  as well as a dashboard that dynamically updates visualizations to help create diversified simulation content.', 'The company had planned to perform real world testing prior to these steps — and it still will in some capacity — but the shutdown forced its hardware engineers to pivot engineering toward simulation.', '“The reality is that all simulation is somewhat limited in that you have to calibrate it and validate it against reality.', 'Specifically  Lyft is refining the techniques it used in simulation to direct agents  such as virtual pedestrians  to react realistically to vehicles  in part with AI and machine learning models.', 'Shifting to a full simulation program without on road tests will slow the progress of autonomous vehicle development in the short term  the company asserts  because developing a simulation with 100  accuracy and complexity might require as much problem solving and resources as developing self driving technology itself.', 'It also leverages planning simulation  which lets Cruise create up to hundreds of thousands of variations of a scenario by tweaking variables like the speed of oncoming cars and the space between them.', 'Elsewhere  Aurora engineers are continuing to build and refine the company’s vehicle maps — the Aurora Atlas — in areas where Aurora Driver will operate when it resumes on road testing  a spokesperson tells VentureBeat.', 'Real world data collection also entails mapping  which in the context of autonomous vehicles refers to the creation of 3D  high definition  centimeter level maps of roads  buildings  vegetation  and other static objects in the world.', 'And GM’s Cruise used a combination of synthetic and real world audio and visual data to train a system that detects police cars  fire trucks  ambulances  and other emergency vehicles.', 'Over time  the simulation scenarios are amplified through a large number of variations to assess the desired behavior of Waymo Driver.', '“Our test track testing is meant to validate our models  so we’re able to maintain  if not accelerate  our pace of development during this time.” Perhaps unsurprisingly  Thompson also says that the virtual cars in Uber’s simulation environment are driving more miles than before the pandemic.', 'Nevertheless  Jonny Dyer  director of engineering at Lyft’s Level 5 self driving division  tells VentureBeat that the company is “doubling down” on simulation by leveraging data from the roughly 100 000 miles its real world autonomous cars have driven and calibrating its simulation environment ahead of validation.', 'A longstanding challenge in simulations involving real data is that every scene must respond to a self driving car’s movements — even though those that

'It’s about a global scramble to stop the spread of COVID 19 and get everyone back to work — without killing privacy or a lot of people in the process.', '“I believe that individual surveillance for purposes of combating the spread of COVID 19 will inevitably involve some trade offs to privacy and civil liberties if they are to be effective.', 'After saving lives  the most urgent — and hotly debated — problem facing government policymakers in the age of COVID 19 may be how to strike a balance between privacy and public health.', '“Maintaining consumer trust in the use of sensitive data in a public health emergency is critical  especially when it relies on the voluntary adoption of consumer facing apps and screening tools ” Gray said.', 'A decentralized app keeps all your data  and the

'Additionally  should initial efforts fail to slow the spread of the disease  the kinds of data and approaches discussed in the hearing could inform increased surveillance efforts.', 'Now U.S. lawmakers seek national legislation to address lingering privacy problems in the age of COVID 19.', '“I think it’s important to consider that the inertia of these kinds of things  that the decisions we make now  will impact privacy for years to come ” Northeastern University professor of computer science and law Woodrow Hartzog said last week in a conversation about privacy and COVID 19.', '“When

per country can use the interoperability API.', '“I think this is an opportunity in the worst way possible for the government to ramp that up and use it not only against undocumented folks and things like that  but to use it more and more for common occurrences ” he said.', 'Richardson joined Calo and other experts in urging Congress to stipulate that the government explicitly state any intended use before obtaining data from businesses.', 'In his testimony  Calo stressed that a sunset clause is necessary to avoid secondary use of data and protect against mission creep.', 'And it casts a harsh light on the state of inequality in the world today and on deep seated issues of power and trust.', '“We see in the context of COVID the same vendors  and  the same law enforcement think tanks

only to public health officials.', 'Calo has also cited the need for a healthy dose of humility when applying AI to problems of global health.', 'One critic of the bill called it deregulation in disguise  and it currently lacks the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  support needed to enforce it.', 'It will take weeks to see if lifting lockdowns cause a spike in new cases  and the weight of this medical and economic tragedy on privacy  surveillance  and our lives will grow heavier until we find an exit strategy.', 'In November 2019  Democratic leaders in the Senate put together a set of privacy principles.', 'A Washington Post University of Maryland poll found that a majority of U.S. citizens are unwilling to download a contact tracing app made by Apple and Google.', 'This is likely to be the case until the death count drops and we achieve herd immunity or a viable vaccine.', 'Multinational groups of tech  privacy  and health experts are developing apps at Stanford and MIT  and the University of Washington is working with Microsoft volunteers on a privacy focused app called CovidSafe.', 'But noise added to data can reduce accuracy — the more noise  the less accuracy — and reduce the ability to audit models for bias results.', 'According to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data released last week  record unemployment during the pandemic is hitting Hispanic and African Americans the hardest.', 'In a recent  illuminating piece of research  partners including the United Nations and World Health Organization cataloged the ways AI can aid in the fight against COVID 19.', 'Ideally  ample testing would mean notifications are sent only after a diagnostic test verifies a person has COVID 19  but testing capacity continues to be an issue in much of the world  including in the U.S.', 'When it comes to recognizing the faces of people in masks  traditional facial recognition systems  including the kind Apple employs for its Face ID and Google for its Face Unlock  fall short — but that’s changing fast.', 'However  an Apple spokesperson told reporters the Exposure Notification API won’t impose a testing confirmation requirement in order to allow doctors to clinically diagnose a patient with COVID 19  in the face of testing kit shortages  and still notify contacts.', 'The World Health Organization  WHO  says artificial intelligence and big data are an important part of the pandemic solution.', 'In the U.S.  Rank One is currently selling facial recognition to law enforcement agencies that it claims can identify people in masks.', '“This is a really

       "'Disease control officials in Wuhan  the Chinese city where the outbreak of the new and rapidly spreading virus began  announced that it’s shutting down transportation within the city and will close all airports and train stations. The city is home to over 11 million people. By Thursday evening  the travel ban had been extended to two more cities as officials began closing off the seven million residents of Huanggang  a city about 30 miles east of Wuhan  and nearby Ezhou  a city of one million. The virus is similar to SARS  which circulated around the world in 2002 and 2003. So far  the new virus has sickened over 500 people and killed 17. In addition to the transportation shutdown  companies like General Motors and Ford are restricting and suspending travel to Wuhan  and Olympic qualifying events have been moved out of the city.   MAJOR BREAKING    Wuhan  ground zero for the China   to be on public transport lockdown as of Thursday 10am  reports . All flights and trains from Wuhan to be cancelled. Our  team JUST got out late this evening.    The decision to shut down Wuhan and its two neighboring cities came as the World Health Organization’s  WHO  International Health Regulations Committee met in Geneva  Switzerland to decide if it would recommend that the WHO declare an international public health emergency in response to the virus. The committee could not come to a decision — it was split fifty fifty — and will meet again tomorrow to review additional information on the outbreak  and vote again. The WHO supports the decision to shut down transportation in and out of Wuhan. “They’re taking action they think is appropriate. We stressed to them that by taking a strong action they will not only control the outbreak in their own country  but will minimize the chance of this outbreak spreading internationally ” said director general Tedros Adhanom in a press conference on the ongoing response to the virus. “We commend their actions  but since we have a team on the ground  we will get more information on the situation and the actions being taken ” he said. The chair of the novel coronavirus International Health Regulations Committee  Didier Houssin  said during the press conference that the committee struggled to come to a decision because the information is still limited on both the severity of the illness caused by coronaviruses and the way the virus spreads. The decision about whether or not to declare a public health emergency of international concern on new   is one I take extremely seriously  and one I am only prepared to make with appropriate consideration of all the evidence. Current evidence suggests that this new coronavirus passes from person to person through close contact. How well it passes between people is still unknown. The good news is that no cases where illness has passed from one person through a second person to a third person have been confirmed  said Mike Ryan  executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme  during the press conference. “The issues that arise are the unknowns  such as whether there are other routes of transmission. At this time it is not possible to determine that absolutely ” he says. Right now the virus appears to spread person to person similarly to other coronaviruses  people who are sick may pass on the virus to family members or health care workers by sneezing or coughing  through what’s called droplet transmission. “If the route is due to close personal contact and droplet transmission  it is containable ” Ryan said. The virus causes a range of symptoms  from mild cold like symptoms to severe respiratory distress and death. The deaths  though  have been primarily in older adults who also had other conditions  like heart disease  that might have put them more at risk. “The fatality rate is still a question mark. That’s one aspect that we would like to have more information on ” Houssin said. Update January 23rd  5 43AM ET  Article updated with the closing of Wuhan’s neighboring cities. '"
